        <strong>Collection of personal data:</strong> <br />
        Personal data are either entered directly by the data subject or, in the
        context of a claims settlement or risk assessment of an object to be
        insured, by the persons who do so on behalf of the data subject (e.g.
        garages or insurance companies).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What personal data are collected and processed?</strong> <br />
        We collect the personal data that are needed to identify data subjects
        in connection with the claims settlement or risk assessment of an object
        in order to enable the handling of business processes (e.g. name,
        address, e-mail address, licence plate). Furthermore, we process
        personal data that we receive by means of contact forms or newsletter
        subscriptions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Purpose of the processing</strong>
        <br />
        We process personal data for claims settlement and risk assessment
        purposes in particular. This includes the conducting of expert reviews
        to ensure quality, particularly in the area of visual intelligence, and
        that some data are used for further development ─ in anonymised form to
        the extent possible. Personal data are also processed for the purpose of
        delivering newsletters and processing all kinds of requests from
        contacting persons. We also need some of the personal data for the due
        provision of our services on our web pages. Furthermore, we use personal
        data for user behaviour analyses in order to further optimise our
        services. Additionally, we process personal data in order to deliver
        newsletters, as well in order to deal with all kinds of enquiries.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Access to and forwarding of personal data</strong>
        <br />
        noimos makes your personal data available to a limited group of users
        within noimos, who need to have access in order for noimos AG to comply
        with its contractual and statutory obligations.
      </p>
      <p>
        noimos forwards personal data to partners and service providers insofar
        as they need the personal data for the performance of statutory or
        contractual obligations (of the partners or of noimos). All partners and
        service providers are under the contractual obligation to treat your
        personal data as confidential and to process your personal data only
        insofar as this is required for the service performance, applying the
        same diligence and care as noimos would.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where a statutory obligation exists to do so, noimos also forwards your
        personal data to public bodies and authorities.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Legal basis for the data processing:</strong> <br />
        If the processing of personal data takes place due to a statutory
        obligation, this will be deemed the legal basis. For example, this may
        be the forwarding to third parties or a retention obligation.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you grant us your consent (e.g. by subscribing to the newsletter),
        this consent will be deemed the legal basis for the processing.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the other cases, we process the personal data on the basis of
        contractual obligations or a legitimate interest, especially to provide
        and further develop our services in connection with a claims settlement
        or risk assessment or to optimise our web pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Storage and retention of personal data</strong>
        <br />
        noimos stores your personal data for as long as it is required to do so
        by law (e.g. retention period) or for as long noimos has a legitimate
        interest in storage in order to perform its services and/or operate its
        web pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Personal data for whose processing there is no statutory basis, no
        legitimate interest and no consent will be erased.
